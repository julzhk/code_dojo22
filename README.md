A London Code Dojo Excersize
===========

An exersize held at the london Code Dojo ( http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/ .)

Coding at the dojo requires participants to follow various principles:
- Elegance is important,
- literate programming, 
- test-first TDD,
- pair-programming 
- and in 30 minute bursts (aka: 'pomodoros')

The Problem
======

This problem was to create a running total calculator using standard input.
The requirements developed over a series of pomodoros and became increasingly complex, & included:
- For every second bag of cherries, get a discount
- Buy 2 Bananas, get one free
- Buy 3 Apples, get one free
- Buy N items, get a discount
- Buy N apples (of any variety) & get a discount
- and so on 

These requirements are all captured in the tests.py file

Conclusions
====

As the requirements developed & became increasingly byzantine managing the code to pass all tests as well as 
not become overly complex and brittle was the real challenge.

Keeping the tests from becoming brittle & unable to change was also a real challenge.
